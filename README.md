Here is the main adventure item feed. It will eventually have filter functionality to filter by category, tags or number of likes

Clicking on the "read more" link will open up the full item page, with some basic info. This one is for a hike, but the other categories will have different information

Here a user can submit their own adventure, which will be reviewed by an admin before being added to avoid duplicate items. This one is for a hike, but an initial dropdown will decide what form the user gets to fill out.

Here is the user's profile page where they can see the items they have submitted (add status later) and create a "bucket list" to save items they would like to do for later.
